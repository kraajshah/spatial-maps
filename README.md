# spatial-maps
This repository contains a small collection of spatial map outputs created through my learning and applied work in GIS and UAV-based mapping. The maps document practical workflows—data preparation, simple spatial overlays, and layout design, and illustrate how spatial evidence can support infrastructure and environmental decision-making.
